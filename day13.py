#         if i == 20:
#             print("You got it")
# my_fucntion()

#2. Reproduce the  Bug
# from random import randint
# dice_img = ["@1", "@2", "@3", "@4", "@5", "@6"]
# dice_num = randint(0, 5)

# #3. Play computer
# year = int(input("What's your year of birth? "))

#     print(f"You can drive at {age}.")
#U5.se print for each output
#6.Use a debugger
