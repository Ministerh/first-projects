#function creating a function
#function is recognize with the use fo parenthesis, by creating a function, the function should be defioned
#with the key word "def" then every instruction should be indented under the function
#when using the function it means "calling the function". example

from decimal import DecimalTuple


def my_function():
    print("Hello")
    print('Minister')
#calling the function
my_function()

#while loop and for loop
#lin  the while loop, a condition is placed where as as long as the condition is true it willits keep executing the command repeatedly
#but in the for loop, a command is given to be executed at a specified amount of time and as long as its not complete it will keep executing it
#the for loop is good when iterating through something and wants to perform and action with that thing
#it's good when you want a repition of something without thinking about how many times you want it to happen
#example of for loop
#for n in range(1, 10): #excluding 10 itself
#    print("n")
#for n in list:
#    print(list)

#examplke of while loop
#while not yield:
#    harvest
#while aplle > 1:
#    Depile
